The IPOE-162 Single-Port, Mid-span Industrial IEEE 802.3at Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE+) Injector provides a maximum of up to 30 watts of power output over Ethernet cables. It is specifically designed to fulfill the growing demand of higher power network equipment such as PTZ (Pan, Tilt & Zoom) network cameras, PTZ speed dome cameras, color touch-screen voice over IP (VoIP) telephones, multi-channel (11a/b/g/n) wireless LAN access points and other network devices that need higher power to work stably.
The IPOE-162 can deliver 30W 56V DC power over Cat.5/5e/6 Ethernet cables which allow data and power to transmit simultaneously through the cable between the Injector (IPOE-162) and PoE PD (powered device) or PoE Splitter (IPOE-162S/POE-162S). The maximum distance between the Injector and Splitter is 100 meters. The IPOE-162 is also compatible with IEEE 802.3af PoE PD or PoE Splitter and provides a maximum of up to 15.4-watt power output. With Industrial IEEE 802.3at Power over Ethernet Plus devices installed, the system administrator only has to use one single RJ45 Ethernet cable to carry both power and data to each device. It would make the network deployment easier and more reliable.
To facilitate the 802.3at PoE usage with commonly used 12~48V DC power input for transportation and industrial-level applications, the IPOE-162 adopts 12~48V DC to 56V power boost technology to solve power source issue but does not require special power supplies. Its wide-ranging voltages design is suitable for worldwide operability with high availability applications requiring dual or backup power inputs.

Standards: 802.3af/802.at
PoE Power Budget: 120 Watts
* Does NOT function as a PoE Switch","
The HPOE-460 is the next generation 4-Port Gigabit High Power PoE injector Hub, featuring both IEEE 802.3af and High Power IEEE 802.3at PoE standard that combines up to 30-watt power output and data per port over one CAT 5/5e/6 Ethernet cable. The HPOE-460 is designed specifically to satisfy the growing demand for higher power consuming network PD (powered devices) such as PTZ (Pan, Tilt & Zoom) / Speed Dome IP cameras, multi-channel (802.11a/b/g/n) wireless LAN access points and other network devices in SOHO and SMB network applications. The IEEE 802.3at Power over Ethernet standard is defined to provide each PoE device maximum up to 30 watts of input power which is double amount of PoE power, more than the conventional 802.3af PoE PSE. The IEEE 802.3at PoE standard is an ideal solution to meeting the high power requirements directly via the RJ-45 Port interface. Compliant with IEEE 802.3at, the HPOE-460 possesses stronger power capability than the existing 802.3af PoE PSE.
With 4 10/100/1000Base-T Gigabit Ethernet ports, the HPOE-460 supports 52V DC power for any remote 802.3af / 802.3at powered device (PD) without affecting data transmission performance. Supporting PoE power budget of 120 watts, the HPOE-460 provides sufficient 15.4 / 30.8-watt PoE power to up to 4 remote PD devices. It offers a cost-effective and quick solution to upgrading network system to IEEE 802.3af / IEEE 802.3at Power over Ethernet system without replacing the existing Ethernet Switch. There are 8 RJ-45 STP ports on the front panel of the HPOE-460, in which 4 ports in the right direction function as ""Data input"" and the other half in the left direction function as ""PoE (Data and Power) output"". The 4 ""PoE (Data and Power) output” ports are also the power injectors that transmit DC voltage to the CAT. 5/5e/6 cable and transfer data and power simultaneously between the Injectors and Splitters.

The Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch Fabric Module 2, in combination with the Supervisor Engine 2, delivers an increase in available system bandwidth from the existing 32 Gbps to 256 Gbps. This significant increase in available bandwidth ensures that the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series continues to deliver not only best-in-class bandwidth, but also the performance and advanced services required for today's most advanced networks. The Switch Fabric Module 2 provides frameworks for delivering high-bandwidth architecture. This switch fabric module is a key enabler for the optional distributed forwarding architecture that facilitates convergence of high traffic volumes at different parts of the network. The Switch Fabric Module 2 enables a new architecture that allows 30 Mpps of Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF)-based central forwarding performance on Supervisor Engine 2 and up to 210 Mpps of distributed forwarding performance. The higher bandwidth and performance enabled by the switch fabric modules, coupled with advanced services such as quality of service (QoS) and security in hardware via access control lists (ACLs), make the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series the premier platform for service providers and enterprises.
Note: The Switch Fabric Module requires a Supervisor Engine 2 and must be installed in slot 5 or slot 6 of the Catalyst 6506, Catalyst 6509, or Catalyst 6509-NEB switches, or in slot 7 or 8 of the Catalyst 6513 switch.

Fiber Connection: SC
Power Consumption: 6.7W max.","
This converter from Planet Technology provides different options and may be configured as a 3 port ethernet switch or as a redundant media converter with 2 ports. The 3-port switch mode option allows for quality performance while utilizing the Store-and-Forward mechanism. It can also work to keep packet loss at a minimum with half-duplex and full duplex technology (Back Pressure and IEEE 802.3x Flow Control).
The 2 port mode offers the automatic recover feature and offers under 10ms of redundancy of link for critical ethernet applications. The unit sends the packet to the other port if one of the packet links are down. The SFP slot also allows for single and multi mode, along with WDM transceiver modules that are small form factory types that work for different applications. The FT-1205A unit is truly reliable and works for ranges from 2km to 20 km or further.
Depending on the 100Base-FX SFP transceiver modules, the signal of the ethernet will allow two different segments to connect quickly and affordably. These units can work independently or as an additional slide in component to a media converter chassis, such as the MC-700, MC-1000R and MC-1500 models from Planet Technology. The MC-chassis features hot swappable technology.

The Industrial 4-port Gigabit Ultra PoE Switch, IGS-5225-4UP1T2S, is equipped with a rugged IP30 metal case for stable operation in heavy industrial demanding environments. Thus, the IGS-5225-4UP1T2S provides a high level of immunity against electromagnetic interference and heavy electrical surges. With operating temperature ranges from -40 to 75ºC, the IGS-5225-4UP1T2S can be placed in almost any difficult environment such as plant floors or curbside traffic control cabinets. The IGS-5225-4UP1T2S also can be installed by either DIN rail or wall mounting for efficient use of cabinet space.
The IGS-5225-4UP1T2S Ultra PoE solution adopts the IEEE 802.3at/af PoE standard. Instead of delivering power over 2-pair twisted UTP be it end-span (Pins 1, 2, 3 and 6) or mid-span (Pins 4, 5, 7 and 8), it provides the capability to source up to 60 watts of power by using all the four pairs of standard Cat5e/6 Ethernet cabling. In the new 4-pair system, the IGS-5225-4UP1T2S is able to deliver up to 60 watts of power per port to each remote PoE compliant powered device (PD). It possesses double amount of power capability than the conventional 802.3at PoE and is an ideal solution to satisfying the growing demand for higher power consuming network PDs.
ONVIF Support is specifically designed for co-operating with Video IP Surveillances. From the IGS-5225-4UP1T2S GUI, clients can search and view all of the ONVIF devices via network application with one click. In addition, clients can upload floor images onto the switch which allows for easier inspection and planning of surveillance devices. Moreover, clients can get real-time surveillance's information, online/offline status, and allow for PoE reboot control from the GUI.
