Starting with the use afront bezel which allows the airflow path to draw cool air from front to back over graphics cards and CPU, the power supply unit and the M.2 SSD storage. Finally, theopen architecture layout means nothing is sitting on top of the CPU and GPU, limiting airflow.Regulated coolingOur engineers designed this system to include voltage regulator cooling with select processors to ensure system optimal performance by maintainingadequate airflow over the VR components. They also selected an optimal location for the placement of the M.2 SSD to maximize performance and rigorous, proprietarytesting ensures that all system components are kept cool, even under the most intensive loads.Designed to stay quietThe XPS Desktop was designed to blend into your environment, whether that be a family room, office or kitchen, you can be assured your desktop will stayquiet, even when it’s performing at its highest.

Starting with the use afront bezel which allows the airflow path to draw cool air from front to back over graphics cards and CPU, the power supply unit and the M.2 SSD storage. Finally, theopen architecture layout means nothing is sitting on top of the CPU and GPU, limiting airflow.Regulated coolingOur engineers designed this system to include voltage regulator cooling with select processors to ensure system optimal performance by maintainingadequate airflow over the VR components. They also selected an optimal location for the placement of the M.2 SSD to maximize performance and rigorous, proprietarytesting ensures that all system components are kept cool, even under the most intensive loads.Designed to stay quietThe XPS Desktop was designed to blend into your environment, whether that be a family room, office or kitchen, you can be assured your desktop will stayquiet, even when it’s performing at its highest.
