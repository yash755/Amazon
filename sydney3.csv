See more product details","The 11.6"" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.38-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68"" -- it tapers down to 0.11"" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 128GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 9 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 11.6"" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1366 x 768. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency."

See more product details","Pure invention. We designed the new MacBook to be not only thinner and lighter, but more functional and intuitive than ever before. To do that, we couldn't just shave a millimeter here, a gram there. So we started from scratch, reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It's everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever. A keyboard reimagined from A to Z. From the beginning, our goal was to design a full, uncompromising Mac experience. And a full-size keyboard is an essential part of that. In order to fit a full-size keyboard in the incredibly thin MacBook, we designed the keyboard from the ground up. Each component has been rethought specifically for the new MacBook, from the underlying mechanism to the curvature of the surface of each key to the distinctive new typeface. The result is a keyboard dramatically thinner than its predecessor. Now when your finger strikes the key, it goes down and bounces back with a crisp, consistent motion that makes typing with precision a breeze. Butterfly mechanism. Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. So we designed an entirely new butterfly mechanism."

See more product details","Pure Invention - We designed MacBook to be not only thinner and lighter, but more functional and intuitive than ever before. To do that, we couldn’t just shave a millimeter here, a gram there. So we started from scratch, reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It’s everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever. A keyboard reimagined from A to Z - From the beginning, our goal was to design a full, uncompromising Mac experience. And a full-size keyboard is an essential part of that. In order to fit a full-size keyboard in the incredibly thin MacBook, we designed the keyboard from the ground up. Each component has been rethought, from the underlying mechanism to the curvature of the surface of each key to the distinctive new typeface. The result is a keyboard dramatically thinner than its predecessor. Now when your finger strikes the key, it goes down and bounces back with a crisp, consistent motion that makes typing with precision a breeze. The 12-inch Retina display on MacBook isn’t just picture perfect — it’s also paper thin. In fact, at just 0.88 millimeter, it’s the thinnest Retina display ever on a Mac. A specially developed automated manufacturing process forms the impossibly thin edge-to-edge glass that’s only 0.5 millimeter thick. And we reduced the space between display components for a tighter, more integrated design. The Force Touch trackpad may look like other trackpads on the surface, but underneath it’s unlike anything that’s existed before. Force sensors detect how much pressure you’re applying, and the new Tap-tic Engine provides a click sensation when you press anywhere on the surface. Now the click that once was a single, mechanical function is just the start of what you can do with Force Touch. The sensory capabilities of the Force Touch trackpad allow you to tell your MacBook what you want it to do based on subtle differences in the amount of pressure you apply. This makes it possible to perform a variety of different actions in different apps, all on the same surface. And it can respond with haptic feedback you can actually feel, making your MacBook more usable and personal than ever before. Inside you’ll find sixth-generation Intel Core m3 with 14-nanometer process technology. This means that the chips are packed with transistors for higher density and more efficient performance. The Core M processors are the perfect fit for MacBook, combining energy efficiency with the performance needed to handle everyday tasks."

Images take on a new level of realism. And text is so sharp, you'll feel like you're reading email, web pages, and documents on a printed page. The Retina display reduces glare while maintaining incredible color and quality. Its high contrast ratio results in blacker blacks and whiter whites. And everything in between is rich and vibrant. IPS technology gives you a wide, 178-degree view of everything on the screen, so you'll see the difference at practically any angle. And you're going to love what you see. The 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display has the power to do even more amazing things. Fourth-generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processors provide the fastest performance ever in a MacBook Pro. You can make quick work of even the most complex tasks in professional apps like Final Cut Pro, thanks to speeds up to 2.8GHz, 6MB of shared L3 cache, and Turbo Boost speeds up to 4.0GHz.

See more product details","With a Retina display and a thin, lightweight design, the gold mid 2017 Apple 12"" MacBook provides both portability and performance. Measuring just 0.5-inch (13.1mm) thin and weighing only 2 pounds, the MacBook is compact yet still has a premium feel, thanks to its unibody design. The MacBook features a 12"" Retina display with 16:10 aspect ratio and 2304 x 1440 native resolution, which results in 226 pixels per inch (ppi). The display also has 178°-wide viewing angles. To deliver the total Retina experience on the MacBook, Apple redesigned the pixels to create a larger aperture, allowing more light to pass through. This enabled Apple to use LED backlighting that's 30 percent more energy efficient than the displays on other Mac notebooks with no loss in brightness. Inside the MacBook you'll find the 7th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core m3 processor, which is designed with 14-nanometer process technology. This means that the chip is packed with more transistors than the previous generation, for higher density and more efficient performance. Since the Intel Core m3 generates less heat, Apple is able to omit the fan. Instead, the logic board, which is 67% smaller than the one in the 11"" MacBook Air, is seated on top of an anisotropic graphite sheet, which helps disperse any heat that is generated out, to the sides. No fan also means the MacBook will be virtually silent. Even with its miniaturized internal components, the MacBook has an impressive capacity, featuring 8GB of fast, power-efficient 1866 MHz LPDDR3 onboard RAM and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage."

Featuring the four-sided NanoEdge display, ZenBook 14 is 13% smaller than the previous generation ZenBook 14 (UX430) and weighs only 2.8 lbs. The new ScreenPad 2.0 upgrades the traditional laptop experience, adding an interactive secondary touchscreen that enhances your productivity and gives you endless possibilities. Its intuitive smartphone-like interface lets you easily manage tasks and create your own seamless multitasking workflow. There’s a series of handy ASUS utility apps to boost productivity including Quick Key — for one-tap automation of complex keyboard sequences — along with Handwriting, Number Key, Doc Xpert, Slide Xpert and Sheet Xpert. ScreenPad 2.0 intelligently fits many apps into the 5.65-inch touchscreen, and you can effortlessly add apps to ScreenPad for instant access. The newly-optimized ScreenPad experience ensures that your favorite apps, such as Evernote and Spotify, will work perfectly on this secondary display right away, without the need for a ScreenPad-specific version. ASUS also works closely with third party developers, including video-editing software developer Corel, to optimize adaptive ScreenPad tools for the ultimate productivity — and there’s much more to come. *The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1 (Gen 1 and 2), and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to system configuration and your operating environment."

Its intuitive smartphone-like interface lets you easily manage tasks and create your own seamless multitasking workflow. There’s a series of handy ASUS utility apps to boost productivity including Quick Key — for one-tap automation of complex keyboard sequences — along with Handwriting, Number Key, Doc Xpert, Slide Xpert and Sheet Xpert. ScreenPad 2.0 intelligently fits many apps into the 5.65-inch touchscreen, and you can effortlessly add apps to ScreenPad for instant access. The newly-optimized ScreenPad experience ensures that your favorite apps, such as Evernote and Spotify, will work perfectly on this secondary display right away, without the need for a ScreenPad-specific version. ASUS also works closely with third party developers, including video-editing software developer Corel, to optimize adaptive ScreenPad tools for the ultimate productivity — and there’s much more to come."

From street markets across Vietnam to our favorite pho joints in the Northwest, we love the complexity of the flavors and the simplicity of a good bowl of soup. Essence of Lotus wants to make the authentic soups we love so much a staple in homes across the country. So, we’ve created flavor-ready pouches of instant broth — add water, noodles and your favorite garnishes and you’ve got a beautiful, restaurant quality broth without the hours of preparation. Simple ingredients, complex flavors. We got here by working backwards. Working with chefs and food scientists, we started with a rich bone base, seeking out a delicate balance of sweet and salt. Then we stirred in spices like star anise, ginger, cinnamon, lemon grass or shallot. We refined each element until we had built our perfect pho broth. That’s how we approach every Essence of Lotus product: starting with a base of good, traditional ingredients; creating a broth that will make you smile. Street Vendors, Chefs, Home Cooks. No matter where you’re cooking, Essence of Lotus is your secret ingredient. Our broths pack the spices and flavors that nourish and satisfy, whether you’re serving pho in a professional kitchen or spicy beef soup at home. Quality products, made in the USA. In every Essence of Lotus product, you’ll find authentic ingredients from trustworthy sources and all blended and packaged here in the Pacific Northwest since 1998. Our products have a shelf life of up to 12 months and are created with food service best practices."

Their craftsmanship, versatility and robust security features ensure they're every professional's preference.

NASA embraced the ThinkPad on both the International and the Mir Space Stations. It's even in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in NY.

We test ThinkPads against 12 military-grade requirements and more than 200 quality checks to ensure they run in extreme conditions.

ALL CHARGED UP: The bountiful power of the Legion 5i doesn’t mean you have to compromise battery life. With a robust battery, you can own the competition wherever you want without a dead battery ending your killstreak. When you do start to run low, Rapid Charge Pro will get you from 0% to 50% in under 30 minutes. Not gaming? Hybrid Mode disables your GPU while Quiet Mode in Q Control 3.0 lowers your voltage requirement for even longer amounts of battery life.
SMOOTH BUT DANGEROUS: The Legion 5i 17 looks as beautifully as it performs. Clean lines infused with subtle design notes, a light-refracting hinge, a logo finish, and anti-smudge polymer talcum-injected materials make this laptop look like a high-performance machine. And its understated Phantom Black body and webcam privacy shutter compliments your daily lifestyle, avoiding the usual loud characteristics of gaming laptops.
