It has multiple transmission modes, working in the 850.125MHz~930.125MHz, (default 900.125MHz), LoRa spread spectrum technology, TTL level output, compatible with 3.3V and 5V IO port voltage.   LoRa direct sequence spread spectrum technology will bring longer communication distance, and has the advantages of concentrated power density and strong anti-interference ability. The module has a software FEC forward error correction algorithm, which has high coding efficiency and strong error correction capability. In the case of sudden interference, it can actively correct the interfered data packets, greatly improving reliability and transmission distance. When without FEC, such packets can only be discarded. The module has data encryption. Data transmitted over the air, with randomness, makes data interception meaningless through strict encryption and decryption algorithms. The module reserves multiple IO interfaces to provide custom development services.It supports packet length setting and also supports different real-time and data packet."

SX1278 support LoRa technology, The LoRa DSSS (direct sequence spread spectrum) technology features long range and strong anti-interference as well as strong data confidentiality.   SX1278 are considered as a milestone in terms of low speed data communication,(default 470MHz) with max 197 bytes per package.SX1278 features LoRa technology, LoRa will bring longer communication distance, and has the advantages of concentrated power density, meanwhile it has a very strong confidentiality. The modules of 20dBm transmitting power adopt industrial grade crystal oscillators to ensure the stability and consistency, its precision is lower than the widely adopted 10ppm.   E32 series are in stable bulk production and are widely applied in utility meters, IoT renovation, smart home, etc. The modules feature data encryption and compression. The data transmitted in air features randomness. The encryption-decryption algorithm makes data interception meaningless. And the data compression enables shorter transmitting time and lower rate of being interfered, which increased the reliability and transmitting efficiency.   E32-400T20S strictly follows design standards of FCC, CE, CCC and meets various RF certification requirements for exporting."

Support 51 STM8S STM32 and other microcontroller development boards.
The CE can be connected high for a long time, but the module must first be set to the POWER DOWN power-down mode when writing to the register. It is recommended to connect the CE to the IO port of the MCU. The IRQ can be disconnected and the interrupt status can be obtained using the polling mode. However, it is recommended to use an external interrupt from the microcontroller.
The module's CE pin timing operation can reach the 10us mentioned in the nRF24L01P technical manual, but we recommend changing it to: operation until CE goes high until the transmit interrupt is completed, then keep 1ms high time, then Lower the CE. The purpose is to switch to receive mode immediately after sending the GT-24. If CE = 0, the LNA is turned off, which will adversely affect the receiving sensitivity.
The CE pin is connected to the LNA enable pin. When CE = 1, the LNA is turned on. When CE = 0, the LNA is turned off. This operation is identical to the transmit and receive modes of the nRF24L01. In other words, the user does not need to care about the operation of the LNA at all.",

Once connected, you can open up your browser and go to 192.168.4.1 You can now scan for networks to Deauther any client. What is Deauther ? Basically it’s a device which performs a deauth action to a client user. You select the clients you want to disconnect from their network and start the deauth function. As long as the deauth is running, the selected devices are unable to connect to their network. How it works? The 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol contains a so called deauthentication frame. It is used to disconnect clients safely from a wireless network.Because these management packets are unencrypted, you just need the mac address of the Wi-Fi router and of the client device which you want to disconnect from the network. You don’t need to be in the network or know the password, it’s enough to be in its range. What an ESP8266 is ? The ESP8266 is a micro controller with built-in Wi-Fi. It contains a powerful 160 MHz processor and it can be programmed using Arduino. Best Use For testing and education !!"

They are half-duplex. TX & RX modems with LoRa technology and transparent transmission mode.   Voltage supply ranges from 8V to 28V. Working frequency: 862~893MHz (Default:868MHz).   The LoRa direct sequence spread spectrum technology enables the longer communication distance and better power density concentration as well as superior anti-interference ability. The FEC algorism enables higher coding efficiency and correction ability. The interfered data packets will be corrected proactively upon sudden interference, which significantly improves reliability and communication distance. Without FEC, the interfered dat a packet will be dropped.   The transceivers feature data encryption and compression. The data transmitted in air features randomness, the rigorous algoris m makes data interception meaningless. The data compression function has possibility to reduce the data transmission time, which in turn reduces the possibility of being interfered, thus improves the reliability and communication efficiency."
