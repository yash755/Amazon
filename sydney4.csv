Simply place your laptop within six feet of the dock and it will do the rest. As well as reducing desktop clutter, this easy-to-use dock can even power all your other devices.
By constantly listening to our customers, we have been able to refine the T470’s TrackPad and TrackPoint. With an improved design that lessens jumps or gaps when scrolling, these pointing devices offer a smoother, cleaner, and more accurate experience. Together with the award-winning ergonomic ThinkPad keyboard, the T470 will soon help you make light work of hard work
Unlike a regular mechanical hard drive, a Solid-State Drive (SSD) has no moving parts and performs faster—including booting up (nearly 3X quicker), opening files (as much as 30% faster), and transferring files (around 200 MB/s, compared to 50-120 MB/s). As well as being quieter, it’s also more reliable, more rugged, and more secure.

Use it in tablet mode to mark up documents. Laptop mode is great for taking notes. And presentation and tent modes help focus students’ concentration and foster teamwork.
Built to take a beating – and keep going Let’s face it: Students can be tough on electronic devices. That’s why we engineered the Lenovo 300e to be durable enough to withstand even the most rough-and-tumble school day: from the bus ride to the classroom to the field trip and beyond. Its semi-rugged design helps ward off damage from bumps and drops. And its keyboard is spill proof thanks to internal drainage channels.
Go beyond the keyboard Students can use the Pen to draw, diagram, and take notes directly on the Lenovo 300e’s display. Pin-point accuracy and precise pressure sensitivity ensure a natural, intuitive writing experience. Palm-rejection technology prevents unintentional marks and makes using the Pen comfortable. The Lenovo 300e lets students’ creativity flourish.
No outlet? No problem Fading batteries distract students and slow down learning. That’s why we engineered the Lenovo 300e to last the whole school day without recharging. And its lightweight, portable profile – just 3.19 lbs / 1.45 kg – means it won’t drag on-the-go students and teachers down. Finish your homework The Lenovo 300e won’t slow you down, thanks to powerful Intel processing, LPDDR4 memory, and fast, efficient storage options.
Connect and collaborate Whether you need to connect to the internet, or to keyboards and mice, the Lenovo 300e will make it happen. Multiple ports deliver powerful and fast connectivity to peripherals. And 2 x 2 AC WiFi primes it for collaboration and exploration.

The unique modular design lets you turn the X1 Tablet into anything from a portable entertainment center, to a creativity device or a productivity laptop. 2. Is Even More Perfect : This new keyboard is just 5.2mm / 0.2"" thin. And of course it works seamlessly with modules snapped into place. But perhaps the best feature is that, unlike the classic keyboards, you can adjust the typing angle for greater comfort, accuracy and speed. . 3. And 10 Hours of Battery Life :Best of all, get a 5-hour battery boost with the Productivity Module. So you can stay unplugged and working (or playing) for up to 15 hours.

It can also be used as a tablet, laptop, or anything in between. And built with post-consumer recycled material, it's a smart, green choice for students and teachers. A rubber bumper around the top cover absorbs the force of side bumps. And the corners are 50% stronger to reduce potential damage if dropped at an angle. In fact, it can withstand drops from up to 90 cm. From hinges to ports, we’ve thought through every detail on how to make the Yoga 11e one tough, durable laptop. Military-specification testing validates the ruggedness, durability, and quality of this machine. Before it gets to you, the Yoga 11e has to pass the most rigorous tests and procedures, including high pressure, humidity, vibration, temperature shock, fungus, and dust. It's then ready for everything - from the classroom to the great outdoors. Whether you're using it as a laptop to take notes or as a tablet to annotate pdfs, the Yoga 11e delivers a rich, intuitive experience with its preloaded education software and integrated apps. With up to 11.5 hours of battery life, you won’t have to worry about scrambling for a charger in the middle of class.",,,,,,

The T470s has an HD web camera and dual array microphones (with background noise reduction) as standard—ideal for whether you're on a call in a busy open plan office or a bustling coffee shop.
Ultra-fast and very secure, the ThinkPad WiGig Dock (optional) can connect effortlessly, wirelessly, and instantly to your T470s and all its peripherals, such as a monitor or backup storage device. Simply place your laptop within six feet of the dock and it will do the rest. As well as reducing desktop clutter, this easy-to-use dock can even power all your other devices.
Unlike a regular mechanical hard drive, a Solid-State Drive (SSD) has no moving parts and performs faster—including booting up (nearly 3X quicker), opening files (as much as 30% faster), and transferring files (around 200 MB/s, compared to 50-120 MB/s). As well as being quieter, it’s also more reliable, more rugged, and more secure.
Windows 10 Professional - Windows 10 Pro comes with built-in security features, including firewall and internet protections to help safeguard against viruses, malware, and ransomware. Sign into your Windows devices three times faster than with a password. Use facial recognition or your fingerprint for instant access. You love your phone. So does your computer. Pick up where you left off, wherever you left off. Webpages, Office1 docs, photos—read, write, and edit them across all your devices.

It features four different ways for you to do what you want: Laptop, Stand, Tent, or Tablet. The secret: Yoga 3 Pro's unique design and touchscreen display allows the screen to flip around 360 degrees. We pioneered the 2-in-1 Yoga laptop, and now it's better than ever. The new Yoga 3 Pro continues Lenovo's tradition of innovation with a device that is more stable, thinner than a pencil, and nearly a half-pound lighter than its predecessor. Crafted from 813 individual pieces of aluminum and steel, the Yoga 3 Pro's watchband-inspired hinge looks great and optimizes your experience no matter which way you use it. What's more, it offers enhanced stability so you can enjoy a great touchscreen experience - and even lay your Yoga flat at a 180 degree angle. The Intel CoreTM M processor is the ideal processor for multimode devices and others that require high performance with great energy efficiency. Starting at a mere 2.6 lbs and just 0.5"" thin, the Yoga 3 Pro is ultraportable - it's perfect for doers on the go. And with up to 9 hours of battery life, you can go all day without recharging. Yoga Harmony adapts to you by intuitively optimizing settings, making app recommendations by mode, and sharing statistics about how you use the device. The Yoga 3 Pro's super-high-resolution QHD+ (3200 x 1800) 10-point multitouch display delivers spectacular visuals, while in-plane switching (IPS) technology assures that images will be crisp across a wide viewing angle. The Yoga 3 Pro features a/c WiFi for internet speeds up to 3 times faster than 802.11n. Premium JBL speakers and Waves Audio work together to deliver an immersive sound experience no matter which way you use your Yoga 3 Pro.",,,,,,

What’s more, with a solid-state drive (SSD)—unlike with a regular mechanical hard drive—there are no moving parts and it performs faster. Boot up time is nearly three times quicker, while opening files is up to 30% faster. Even transferring files takes significantly less time. So in addition to delivering powerful performance, the X270 is quieter and more reliabl
The X270 features convenient setup and deployment, as well as being highly manageable for when you need to service, upgrade, or secure. These laptops are engineered to make life—and work—easier for everyone, from the business professional to the IT technician.
No matter where you are when you need to make a conference call, the HD webcam and noise-cancelling microphones on the X270 always ensure a great call experience. Plus, the 12.5-inch HD display delivers sharp, vibrant visuals—perfect for working on the go or kicking back to enjoy a movie.
When WiFi is out of range, the X270 has LTE-A available—so you’ll always have connectivity and access to all your data and apps in the cloud. With two batteries and Power Bridge technology, the X270 affords great flexibility. And it’s lightweight, starting at just under three pounds. Feel free to leave the adapter behind and forget about searching for power outlets. Imagine instead what you could do with up to 13 hours of battery life.
With Windows Hello, you’ll never have to remember another password. Simply touch the fingerprint scanner to log in to your X270. ThinkPad X270 is available with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Signature Edition. No more trialware or unwanted apps. No more distractions—and easy provisioning for IT pros.

NASA embraced the ThinkPad on both the International and the Mir Space Stations. It's even in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in NY. No small wonder then, that we've sold well over 100 million of these reliable devices-thanks in part to loyal X Series customers. Built to go on and on. And on.
